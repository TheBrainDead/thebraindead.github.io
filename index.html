        <h2>Disproportionate Punishments</h2>
        <p>Many people do not realize that mandatory minimums can actually affect minors. Any youth transferred to an adult court will have to face the same mandatory minimums as any adult, not taking into account their young age. Such harsh sentencing can have extremely negative long-term impacts on juveniles, as seen by the finding that youth transferred to adult courts were 34% more likely to reoffend (Hahn). Everyone makes mistakes, especially children still figuring things out in this world. However, unforgiving mandatory minimums can force our youth into cycles of incarceration and recidivism.</p>
        <p>For example, Zyion Houston-Sanders and Treson Roberts, two boys under 18 years of age, were arrested for stealing candy and cell-phones. How many years in prison would you give them? 1 year? 2 years? Zyion ended up with 31 years and Treson with 26 years. Even the judge “wished he could have done more to reduce their sentences.” To avoid such tragedy from tearing apart our families we must get rid of mandatory minimums. </p>

      <h2>Judicial Discretion Erosion</h2>
      <p>As we've seen from Zyion's case, mandatory minimums effectively take away the discretion of judges. With judges being unable to decide fair punishments, sentences don't take into account any individual circumstances. The whole purpose of the justice system and parts of the Constitution such as the 6th amendment are to guarantee people get their deserved punishment whether that be low or high. The current system with mandatory minimums isn’t just unfair. It is unsafe. Every case is different. Judges should be able to use their experience and knowledge to sentence people fairly. Mandatory minimums make that impossible.  </p>
      <p>Let’s be clear: holding people accountable is important. But mandatory minimums take away second chances, especially from kids who need them most.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Overcrowded Prisons</h2>
      <p>You might be surprised to learn that one of the reasons our prison system is so overcrowded is mandatory minimum sentencing. Between 1980 and 2010, the U.S. prison population increased by over 222%, and much of that came from mandatory minimums making people stay locked up longer. Overcrowded prisons mean less access to healthcare, mental health support, and education, making it harder for people to reenter society and not reoffend. And it’s expensive. Housing prisoners costs taxpayers billions of dollars. That money could be used for schools, youth programs, or family services.
        </p>
      <p>Mandatory minimums do not make us safer. They fill our prisons, waste money, and destroy opportunities for real rehabilitation.</p>
